# imageCorruptor
Tool for corrupting images  
Usage is simple, press the load image button, set tries to somewhere around 15-90 and strength 2-5  
I got better results when strength is an even number  
The way it works is by inserting random characters into the file  
It works with only jpgs and pngs, but i got the best results with jpgs  
Here are some examples:
